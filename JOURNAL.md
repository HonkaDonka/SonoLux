## May 24: Research
Here's a mini list of what I want to include in this project:
- Some sort of capacitive touch
- LEDs (preferably addressable ones)
- Sound
- Audio input
- Built-in audio playback

I based this project off of a launchpad (image below), which is a grid of buttons each assigned to a sound. However, I also wanted to add my own spin on it (hence the capacitive touch + audio input).

I looked up some capacitive touch ICs and settled on the MPR121 becuase of the available documentation and its price. According to [its datasheet](https://lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2410010232_NXP-Semicon-MPR121QR2_C91322.pdf), each chip supports up to 12 channels and it can be configured into four different I2C addresses. This only makes 48 channels for capacitive touch, but I'm planning to work around this by adding another I2C bus for an additional two units of the IC.

For the LED lighting in the project, I'm planning on using WS2812B LEDs because they are addressable. Yes, they are more expensive than regular LEDs, but they eliminate the need for shift registers and only require one data line. Plus, I already have experience programming them (Check out my [HonkaCube](https://github.com/HonkaDonka/LEDCube) project!)

For audio playback, I have an SD card module (no SD card though üòî) and a MAX98357 amp already. The only thing I'm missing regarding this is a speaker. 

Next up:
Perhaps prototype a 1x1 LED + capacitive sensing (using ESP32's built-in pins)
Figure out all the electronics needed + PCB design

**Time spent this session: 2 hours**

## May 25: More Research + KiCad
I'm thinking of using a PCB with copper pads connected to the MPR121s. The copper pads would be for capacitive touch sensing and would connect directly to the MPR121 channels. To protect the copper rings, I'm planning on having a thing sheet of acrylic above the PCB. However, this means the top layer would have to be completely flat, so all electronics that stick out would have to be mounted on the bottom (including the MPR121s)

This is where I ran into a major roadblock: since I'm planning on using WS2812B LEDs, I'd have to somehow mount them in such a way that sits flush with or below the copper rings. At first, I was thinking of having two PCBs: one would be the 8x8 matrix of LEDs, and the copper rings would sit right on top, with cutouts so the light can shine through. There are plenty of 8x8 matrices available on Aliexpress as well. However, I'd have to design "around" those LED matrices, and many of them aren't as big as I want anyways. 

After doing a bit of research, I decided to use reverse-mount LEDs (SK6812-Mini-E). These are also addressable, so I can use the same [libraries](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoMatrix) I've been using for my previous projects.

To begin creating the PCB, I did a bunch of digging for KiCad footprints and other components. 

### KiCad Time

I took a look at the MPR121 datasheet and found a good reference on how to hook it up to VCC and configure the I2C addresses.

According to the datasheet, attaching ADDR to other pins changes the I2C address. Apparently it can also control LEDs üòÆ, but that's not what I'm using them for.

I also created a footprint and a symbol for each "tile" (copper pad + SK6812). The symbol was simply an addressable LED symbol with an extra pin.

Additionally, I started creating the actual schematic for the project.

## May 26: A LOT of KiCad

I searched far and wide to find footprints for specific breakout boards I was using. Additionally I had to made sure I had mapped out the pins correctly on the ESP32, as this is easily one of the most ambitious projects I'm making. 

Idea: One thing I was thinking of was leaving extra pin headers in case I want to add a rotary encoder or something after the PCB is made. 

In KiCad, I spent a lot of time creating the schematic and laying out the PCB.

What the current PCB looks like:

I'm trying to keep the PCB at two layers, but its a little difficult routing the connections becase of the big capacitive touch pads I made on the front layer. 

**Time spent this session: 4 hours**

## May 29: Too much KiCad

I did some journal updates and added some details + fixed some errors. 

For portability, I want to add a LiPo battery into the Launchpad and that means I need to have a charging and battery protection circuit. Luckily I found [this guide](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-LiPo-ChargeProtect5V-Boost-Circuit/) on how I can do just that!

However, that's an addition I'm going to work on later. For now I need to continue routing connections on my PCB and soon get started on the modeling of the enclosure. 

I tried to use an autorouter(freerouting) for all the IC connections because they were going to be really time consuming, but it turns out autorouters aren't the smartest (it tried to delete my entire PCB).

This is what the board looks like currently. I haven't added the SDA/SCL lines just yet.

## June 1: I messed up

Switched to 4 layer PCB. I added a ground plane and a 5V plane, making wiring so much simpler. 

Also decided to make the LiPo battery circuit external to the board in favor of space and fear of frying things if I made a mistake.
